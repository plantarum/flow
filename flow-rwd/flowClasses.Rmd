# Data Slots

## data
    
The original flowFrame object. Could extract the actual column we use to
save on storage space, but a typical(?) object is only about 0.58 MB (this
from `object.size(parent.fitting.cfse)` in the flowFit vignette).

At some point we need to drop the highest value from the data column, which
is distorted by clipping. Not sure how this should be done. Probably best
to leave the data as-is here.

## channel

character, the name of the column from data to use in the analysis

## bins

numeric, how many bins to use for the data analysis. Paul Kron prefers 256,
but it should probably depend on how much data we have. This is a form of
smoothing, and too much will inflate the model fit. Too little and the
model fit may be reduced by too much granularity in the data. That is,
having 300 counts in one bin, vs having three adjacent (narrower) bins with
150, 0 and 150 counts. This is probably something that can be tuned as a
model parameter, if we were so inclined.
